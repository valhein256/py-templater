### Assignment
Create a Python web application, using Django or other frameworks, to search for top N elements from an integer array. The application should provide an endpoint to accept requests and respond accordingly. For example, an input of `10,30,20,21,11,22,33,44,15,33,10,30` will yield an output of `44,33,33,30,30` for the top five elements in descending order. The input can be very big. The implementation is expected to handle an array at the size of one million. Please avoid array sorting and be aware of memory usage.
